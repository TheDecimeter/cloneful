This browser-only version of Drawful by Jackbox Games supports a similar game where users are given a prompt and must draw their interpretation of it; other players then must guess what the picture is and then choose the correct answer from all the other users guesses. The app supports multiple "room" of players playing simultaneous games with each room taking 8 people.
